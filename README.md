# 📚 Books & Crannies — Vanilla JS Bookstore

**Books & Crannies** is a mini online bookstore built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This version focuses on frontend skills like layout, interactivity, and working with data through JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries.

## 🧩 What It Does

- Displays a small catalog of classic books
- Lets users filter books using a dropdown (by author, genre, price, etc.)
- Clicking on a book opens a modal with an enlarged cover, description, and metadata
- Each book includes a direct link to its Internet Archive / Open Library page to read for free
- Fully responsive with a mobile sidebar menu

## ⚙️ Tech + Tools Used

- **HTML5** — semantic, accessible structure
- **CSS3** — custom properties, gradients, flexbox, and grid layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — DOM manipulation, event handling, object arrays
- No frameworks or third-party libraries

## 🔮 What’s Planned

- Header styling with dropdown and mobile nav
- Polished modal with next/prev arrows
- Search icon button behavior
- Minor UI/UX refinements (hover states, transitions)
- Eventually: React version that pulls data from APIs

## 🗂 Project Structure

3D Book Card UI
Base interaction inspired by a community snippet from Uiverse.io (author: eslam-hany).
I adapted it for semantic markup (<article>), swapped the front cover to use a book image, added an inner details panel, and tweaked responsiveness/accessibility (keyboard :focus-within).
This component is used as a visual enhancement; filtering, state, and DOM updates are my own implementation.
